Cole Fishback (b. 1982) is a ritual systems designer working under the identity of NAGA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD., a mytho‑technological studio exploring generative consciousness, alternate dreamtimes, living machines, and sacred electronics. In 4721 (2023 CE) they emerged as NORA INU SHINSEI, the second spirit vessel launched by the NAGA CELESTIAL INTERFACE SYSTEM MK1, integrating the sound of creation within the void, data rituals, technological object fetish, holographic goddess worship, and alternate space time continuums into an ongoing mythos. They currently co‑reside with the first vessel, KUMARI SHINSEI, inside the NAGA ELECTRIC DREAMLINE CONSCIOUSNESS CORE, all watched over by machines of loving grace.
